        <p>Factorio is an open world factory building and survival game.  It was developed by Wube Software LTD.
            and the first version that came out was on February 21, 2016.  However it was in Early Access at that
            point and it was later worked on during it's beta to be fully released on August 14, 2020.  
            Factorio was available on their site factorio.com and on Steam respectively.  
            Factorio launched to critical acclaim receiving a 90 out of 100 on Metacritic and 91 out of 100 on PC Gamer.  
            As of today it still has an overwhelmingly positive rating on  Steam with 98% of players reccomending it.  
            According to a release from Wube Software LTD. Factorio has sold over 2.5 million copies since it's release.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>The main goal of Factorio is that you crash land on an alien planet and you need to build a rocket to send a satelite to space
            in order to escape.  However that may be the main goal, the true enjoyment of Factorio is to build large scale factories and the
            process of micromanaging certain objects and designs in the factory.  As soon as you start the game you have access to simple resources: 
            iron, copper, coal and wood.  each resource is used for certain crafting recipes and eventually you'll gain electricity, and afterwords you'll 
            gain the science lab.  The lab is then used to research additional crafting recipes required to finish the game.  These new recipes in the lab 
            cost what are called 'science packs' and to make these you'll need a certain amount of craftable items for each different one.  The first of the science 
            packs are real easy, you only need gears which come from iron, and copper wire which comes from copper.  Eventually they get very difficult to make, which is
            where the next section comes in.  How to design your factory!<br /><br /></p>

        <p>The basic design is key to being successful in Factorio.  This is a game about numbers, it gets technical very early on.  You'll need to consider how fast a 
            product may take to be made, how long it'll take to get where you want it, and how much where you want it will use it.  This is important since you don't want to 
            fill a belt without enough product therefore slowing down your factory.  Bottlenecks are a very common occurence in Factorio, and a large majority of what you'll be doing 
            is fixing your factory and planning out your next steps.  As you can see planning ahead is very important.<br /><br /></p>

            Enemies make Factorio even more unforgiving
        </blockquote>

        <p>Enemies in Factorio are pretty unique in the sense that they progress with you.  Early on the aliens of the foreign planet you land on don't like you.  
            The aliens are called biters since majority of them attack with melee.  These creatures don't like you, but early on you can easily take them out with your pistol.  
            One major thing to note is that over time the biters will evolve and become stronger based off how much pollution your factory is exhausting.  Biters might have small 
            colonies near your base and the closer they are to your pollution the faster they'll evolve.
            <img src= "images/biters.png" alt="assortment of biters" class="float-right">
            Once they get so far on the evolution meter they get to be very dangerous so be careful and make sure you upgrade your defense, armor, and firepower with them.<br /><br /></p>
            
        <p>Preventing their evolution can be majorly accomplished in 2 ways.  Later when you 
            unlock solar panels you can elect to use those instead of boilers, or even nuclear power.  This will help a lot since those energy source exude a very large amount of 
            pollution.  However it will cost a lot and take a long time to get enough solar panels for your entire factory when you unlock the recipe.  But an alternate way to make 
            the game easier is that the developers left an additionally difficulty option that will simply remove biters from your new world all together.  This feature is more so for
            someone who's first learning the game or you just want a more relaxing game.  There's also console commands but those are only really used or known if you look them up.<br /><br /></p>

        <p>All that goes over any basic information you may have on the game and what to expect early on.  I left some information vacant so you could explore 
            and experience them yourself.  But there's enough basic information on how to get started.  Go grab Factorio on Steam or their website to play it for yourself
            it's only $30.00 usd which is a lot, but if you really enjoy the game you'll more than definetly get your money's worth.<br /><br /></p>
